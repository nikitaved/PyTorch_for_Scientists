# PyTorch for Scientists
A presentation/notebook that expresses my view on things to make PyTorch efficient that targets researchers in AI and other domains.

It is Work In Progress [WIP], and I plan on expanding it.

Meanwhile, if you find the content useful, please, feel free to:
* Share it with your friends and collegues.
* Play with the notebook and use the code/text as you see fit.
* Create an issue if you see issues like typos or mistakes.
* Create an issue if there are topics you would like to learn more about.
* Star the repository to bump my GitHub credibility :)

And, of course, have fun doing High Performance Computing with PyTorch!

**Note**: I used `notebook=7.3.2` with integrated RISE in case you want to access/modify the slideshow mode.
